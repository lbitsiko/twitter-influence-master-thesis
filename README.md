Title:
Influence and Centrality Measure studies for Online Social Networks

Abstract:
Modelling the function of an online social network and finding the most influencial user is one of the
most intriguing and complex applications of Graph Theory today. The problem of quantifying influence is a
difficult and loosely defined task that has tremendous importance in businesses involved in online marketing
and therefore is a milestone for Operational Research. As a start, an introduction to Operational Research
with an emphasis in Modelling is presented. In addition, Graph Theory is introduced presenting various
definitions, examples and properties of directed and undirected graphs with the appropriate mathematical
formalism. We continue with an analysis of the PageRank algorithm for classifying websites according to
their importance, an algorithm greatly important for classifying social networks users as well. The notion
of Centrality/Influence is also analyzed extensively presenting various centrality measures. Continuing,
Twitter, an online microblogging social network, is presented and modeled with the use of Graph Theory
while some influence measures specifically defined for Twitter are introduced. Lastly, the Twitter model is
applied to a real dataset constituted of users and their interactions while we attempt not only to find the
most influential users in the dataset but possible correlations between various influence measures.
